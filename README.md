# Covid-19 Trend Report

By Tobias KÃ¤chele (https://tobiaskaechele.de)

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the dataset of newly confirmed cases from John Hopkins and outputs an up-to-date trend report for a small selection of countries. It is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation to generate multiple interpolations of a trend curve - using the Savitzky-Golay filter to smoothen the data - and determines the likelihood of a positive or negative trend of each day. Finally, a report in the form of a single HTML file is generated listing the countries and the current trend.

You can find a complete explanation of the math behind it on my blog:<br>
